Title: Kernel Flows for learning dynamical systems from data with application to time series forecasting

Learning dynamical systems from data can be done by regressing the vector field with a
kernel. In this project, we present kernel flow algorithm as a numerical approach to learn the
kernel from data. We explore the performance of this algorithm in the context of time series
forecasting from the benchmarking dataset TSDL.

-->"test_dynamical_systems.py"  : in this file, we can apply KFs to some chaotic dynamical systems 
 (Logistic map, HÃ©non map and Lorenz system) and to a synthetic time series.
